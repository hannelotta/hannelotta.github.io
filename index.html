                  <p>
                     I have been working as a software developer since 2012. I have built and maintained web applications using the .NET framework,
                     lately mainly using .NET Core 3.1 and a bit of .NET 5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I also have experience in database migration and microservice integration.

               <p>
                  I joined a greenfield development project, that integrates Microsoft Office 365 Exchange with F-Secure's backend
                  APIs for advanced threat detection and protection from harmful URLs and file attachments.
                  I helped develop the product so that we were able to release it to customer market.
                  <br />
                  I've helped develop high performance backend applications using benchmarking as a way to do performance optimization.
                  I've also done a lot of CPU and memory profiling to find and fix memory leaks in .NET Core console applications.
                  <br />
                  I've learned to develop applications in the cloud using Amazon Web Services and components such as DynamoDB (NoSQL),
                  SQS (fully managed queuing service), ECS (container service), among others.

               <p>
                  I developed a user interface for accessing financial transactions to monitor money laundering activities.
                  I maintained business critical software for assessing clients’ credit eligibility and managing their credit card information.
                  I integrated and refactored various web applications to make the company's credit application process more reliable and coherent.
                  I learned a lot about continuous integration and deployment practices, and how unit testing is critical in code bases that are updated multiple times a day and deployed to production at least weekly. In our team I promoted good practices related to code reviews and general workflow.

                  I designed and implemented web applications for various humanitarian and advocacy associations.
                  These included customized CRM systems and financial management and invoicing systems with reporting features and integrations to other applications.
                  I also developed and maintained pharmaceutical databases and applications related to medication therapy and
                  medication safety research. This job taught me to communicate with non-technical customers and during this time I learned a lot of what I know about professional programming.
