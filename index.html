                     I have been working as a software developer since 2012. I have built and maintained web applications using .NET.
                     I also have experience in database migration and microservice integration.

                  I was part of a development team maintaining an Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for 
                  car leasing for Secto Automotive. This included new feature development and API integration as 
                  well as fixing issues and providing end user assistance. In addition to this, I helped to plan and 
                  implement functionality to support VAT rate changes in the customer’s ERP system.

                  I was in a product development team implementing and maintaining a loan management system 
                  for Valtiokonttori. From 2022 to 2023 we successfully migrated customer's legacy system and its 
                  data to a modern platform. I was responsible for data migration, which involved eliciting 
                  requirements, and coordinating with the customer, product owner and developers. Technically the 
                  data migration was implemented with SQL, Azure CLI and PowerShell scripts. In the team, ways of
                   working included code reviews, tests and automated build pipelines. Full stack development with 
                  focus on back-end and Azure cloud.

                  I joined a greenfield development project that integrated Microsoft Office 365 Exchange with F
                  Secure's backends for advanced threat detection and protection from harmful URLs and file 
                  attachments. After the project, the company was able to release the product to customer market.
                  I helped develop high performance backends using benchmarking as a way to do performance 
                  optimization. I did CPU and memory profiling to find and fix memory leaks in .NET Core console 
                  applications. My daily work also involved developing applications in the cloud using Amazon Web 
                  Services and components such as DynamoDB (NoSQL), and SQS (fully managed queuing 
                  service).

                  I was hired to develop internal tools in a small team of .NET developers. I ended up working in a 
                  multi-vendor team, different business units and quality assurance team to successfully migrate part
                   of their system to work with new core banking software.
                   I developed a user interface for accessing financial transactions to monitor money laundering 
                  activities. I maintained business critical software for assessing clients’ credit eligibility and 
                  managing their credit card information.
                   I also integrated and refactored various web APIs to make the company's credit application 
                  process more reliable and coherent. During my time at Aktia, I learned a lot about continuous 
                  integration and deployment practices, and how unit testing is critical in code bases that are 
                  updated multiple times a day and deployed to production at least weekly. I promoted good 
                  practices related to code reviews and general workflow.
