              My work experience
            </h3>
            <p>
              I have been working as a software developer since 2012. Mostly I have built and maintained web applications using the .NET framework.
              I also have experience in database migration and microservice integration.
            </p>

              Software developer, Aktia Bank Plc, Helsinki
            </h4>
            <p>
              From May 2017 to March 2019 (1 year 10 months)<br />
              I developed a user interface for accessing financial transactions to monitor money laundering activities.
              I maintained business critical software for assessing clients’ credit eligibility and managing their credit card information.
              I integrated and refactored various web applications to make the company's credit application process more reliable and coherent.
              I learned a lot about continuous integration and deployment practices, and how unit testing is critical in code bases that are updated multiple times a day and deployed to production at least weekly. In our team I promoted good practices related to code reviews and general workflow.

              Software developer, Kehätieto Oy, Helsinki
            </h4>
            <p>
              From January 2012 to May 2017 (5 years 5 months)<br />
              I designed and implemented web applications for various humanitarian and advocacy associations.
              These included customized CRM systems and financial management and invoicing systems with reporting features and integrations to other (mostly invoicing) applications.
              I also developed pharmaceutical databases and applications related to medication therapy and
              medication safety research. This job taught me to communicate with mostly non-technical customers. During this time I learned a lot of what I know about professional coding.

            <p>
              August and September 2009 (2 months)<br />
              This was a summer internship, during which I studied the domain of the company and developed a prototype mobile application for
              viewing stock market information.

              Various job titles at various employers
            </h4>
            <p>
              Between 2006 and 2008<br />
              After graduating from upper secondary school I gained work experience by working for a number of employers,
              including Veikkaus Oy Ab (dispatch department), ISS Palvelut Oy (cleaning), Stockmann Oy Ab (customer service),
              Lassila & Tikanoja (cleaning) and Mint of Finland Ltd (coin packing). I enjoeyd cleaning the most — it is my backup career path in case I forget how to code.
