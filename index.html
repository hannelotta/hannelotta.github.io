                  <p>
                     For the last couple of years I've been working with backend technologies,

                  I was hired to develop internal tools in a small team of .NET developers.

                  to successfully migrate part of their system to work with new core banking software.

                        I learned a lot about continuous integration and deployment practices, and how unit testing is critical in code bases that are updated multiple times a day and deployed to production at least weekly.
